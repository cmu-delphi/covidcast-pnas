\caption{Geo-wise correlations between cases and lagged cases 1, 2, or 3 weeks prior, for all counties in the U.S. Lagged cases are correlated with cases as one might expect, but note the precipitous drop in correlation in February 2021. This matches the correlation drop between other COVIDcast signals and cases during the same time period, supporting the hypothesis that the drop was due to decreased heterogeneity in case rates by county.}\label{fig:case-correlation-lagged-plot}

(HHS data was not consistently reported before August 2020; furthermore, as with cases in the previous trend plots, the HHS data has been smoothed using a 7-day trailing average.) Hospitalizations are displayed on the rate scale: counts per 100,000 people. Other signals are scaled to have the same range. HSP-Hosp is the percentage of new hospital admissions with COVID-associated diagnoses, based on claims data from health system partners (smoothed in time and adjusted for systematic day-of-week effects).}\label{fig:hospitalization_time_trends_national}
