# The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey: Continuous real-time measurement of COVID-19 symptoms, risks, protective behaviors, testing, and vaccination

This directory contains code and text for "The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact
Survey: Continuous real-time measurement of COVID-19 symptoms, risks, protective
behaviors, testing, and vaccination". The final published version is available
at <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2111454118>.

Tables and figures for the paper are generated by two files:
`code/paper-tables.Rmd`, which generates most tables and figures, and
`code/vaccine-acceptance-race.R`, which generates the top panel of Figure 6.

Generating the tables and figures requires survey microdata, which is available
to researchers associated with universities or non-profit organizations who sign
a Data Use Agreement (DUA). The data is hence not included in this repository.
Information on how to request access is [available on our documentation
website](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/data-access.html).
The code also uses auxiliary data, such as Census information, which is included
here; comments in the code indicate the source of each data file used.

A preprint PDF is included in `paper/` along with the rendered versions of all
figures.
