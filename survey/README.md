# Continuous Real-Time Measurement of COVID-19 Symptoms, Risks, Protective Behaviors, Testing and Vaccination

This directory contains code and text for "Continuous Real-Time Measurement of
COVID-19 Symptoms, Risks, Protective Behaviors, Testing and Vaccination".

Tables and figures for the paper are generated by two files:
`code/paper-tables.Rmd`, which generates most tables and figures, and
`code/vaccine-acceptance-race.R`, which generates the top panel of Figure 6.

Generating the tables and figures requires survey microdata, which is available
to researchers associated with universities or non-profit organizations who sign
a Data Use Agreement (DUA). The data is hence not included in this repository.
Information on how to request access is [available on our documentation
website](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/data-access.html).
The code also uses auxiliary data, such as Census information, which is included
here; comments in the code indicate the source of each data file used.
