\caption{Correlation of the difference in WIS with the difference in median predictions for the AR model relative to the indicator-assisted forecaster. In down periods, improvements in forecast risk are highlycorrelated with lower median predictions. The opposite is true in up periods. This suggests, as one might expect that improved performance of the indicator-assisted model is attributable to being closer to the truth then the AR model. This conclusion is stronger in down periods then in up periods.}\label{fig:upswing-corr-table}

The right panel shows $\CCF(a)$ for different values of $a$ as vertical blue bars. The orange dashed lines indicate the 95\% significance threshold.
