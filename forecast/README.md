# Can Auxiliary Indicators Improve COVID-19 Forecasting and Hotspot Prediction?

This directory contains code and some data for "Can Auxiliary Indicators Improve COVID-19 Forecasting and Hotspot Prediction?".

The LaTeX source of the paper is presented in `paper/` in PNAS's standard LaTeX
template. This can be rendered using a standard LaTeX distribution. The main
file is `paper/paper.tex`. The Supplemental Information is generated using the R code in `paper/supplement.Rmd`, a standard Rmarkdown file.

The entire analysis can be rerun using the workflow in the `code/` directory and described more fully in that `code/README.md`. However, this is likely to require around a week of CPU time. For this reason, we have also made intermediate data available in Dataverse at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/UW4VTC . Downloading these `.RDS` files to `forecast/data/` will allow the Supplemental Information and the paper to be recompiled with minimal additional effort.
